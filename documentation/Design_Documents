Module Description:
makepasswd.js-
Input: A file named password.txt.
Input: A password.txt file with emails and passwords in the format email:password. The length and amount do not matter.
Input: A secret key, which encrypts your information so only you can decrypt it.

Output: A file named password.enc.txt
Output: password.enc.txt contains information in the email:hash format

password.js-
Input: User email
Input: User password
Input: password.enc.txt file in the format email:hash
Input: a secret key used to encrypt password.enc.txt

Output: Returns true or false if the user email and password matched with decrypted information from the password.enc.txt file


Information:
The initial information is read using the fs, or FileSync module. It is then put into an array and split by empty lines to differentiate
between different emails and passwords. It is then mapped by splitting apart the email and password by the ':'. A cipher is then created
by a secret key, and each email/password is given a new hash. This email:hash combo is written into a new file called password.enc.txt.
The information is then read by the password.js program. The password.js program also introduced more data, being the user input. The input
is stored in a new variable that combines both the email and the password into the same format as found in the password.enc.txt and password.txt
files. The information in the password.enc.txt file is then decrypted using the secret key, and stored in a new array. Finally, we check the new
decrypted array to see if there is an exact match with the user information.
